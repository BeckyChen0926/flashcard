# Vuex-flashcards

This is a basic statically served flashcard game built with vue.js and vuex.

## Installation

To get started, be sure to have [yarn][yarn] and node installed. Then run the
following commands:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn serve # to start the development environment
```

## Deployment

This will build the application and then add the `dist` directory to the
`gh-pages` branch before pushing to Github.
